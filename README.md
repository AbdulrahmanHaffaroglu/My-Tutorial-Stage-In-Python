# My-Tutorial-Stage-In-Python
Some Exercises that i have done while learning python;
I'am not taking any credibility for this repository, the exercises here aren't my own ideas;
I'am just sharing my learning process for the fun of it and to show examples for exercises that could be done so others can see it too;
No modifying, only copying or reusing the code;
Thank you very much!
